==========
Snow White
==========
This repository holds an EDXML_ file containing a short version of the 19th-century German fairy tale "Snow White".
The file is intended to be used to illustrate how EDXML can be used to transform data into stories that both humans and machines can understand. 

A demonstration can be found `here <http://edxml.org/intro>`_.
